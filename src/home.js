          <h4>Rules For Fully Vaccinated Travelers</h4>
          <p>Fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada will no longer be</p> <p>subject to pre-arrival COVID-19 testing requirements. Fully </p><p>vaccinated travellers may still be randomly selected for post</p><p>-arrival testing but will not have to quarantine while awaiting</p><p> their test result. All travellers must still submit their mandatory</p><p> information in ArriveCAN before they arrive in Canada, and</p><p> travellers who fail to submit the required information may be</p><p>subject to COVID-19 testing and 14-day quarantine requirements</p><p> regardless of vaccination status.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h4>Rules For Unvaccinated Or Partially Vaccinated Travelers</h4>
          <p>Travellers who are not fully vaccinated or are partially vaccinated</p><p> will still be subject to more restrictive travel rules. Unvaccinated</p><p> and partially vaccinated travellers are still unable to board</p><p> flights, trains, or cruise ships departing from Canada or arriving</p><p> to Canada. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated travellers must</p><p> also take a PCR pre arrival test. Foreign nationals who are</p><p> unvaccinated are not eligible to board a flight to Canada.</p>

It marked a record-breaking year for Canada, and was the first time since 1913 the country landed over 400,000 immigrants.</p>
